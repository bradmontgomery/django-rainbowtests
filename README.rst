django-rainbowtests
===================

|version| |license|

This is a custom test runner for Django that gives you *really* colorful test
output.

How do I use this?
------------------

Install the latest release with::

    pip install django-rainbowtests

Then, add one of the following settings. For the ``DiscoverRunner`` behavior
that was introduced with Django 1.6, use the following::

    TEST_RUNNER = 'rainbowtests.test.runner.RainbowDiscoverRunner'

If you want the *old-style* behavior (Django 1.5 or older), use::

    TEST_RUNNER = 'rainbowtests.test.simple.RainbowTestSuiteRunner'

Then run your tests!


Python/Django Compatibility
---------------------------

This code *should* work with Django 1.4 - 1.8, Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. If you
find otherwise, please open an Issue.


Coverage
--------

As of version 0.3.0, there is (experimental) support for `coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_.

Use

    TEST_RUNNER = 'rainbowtests.test.runner.RainbowDiscoverCoverageRunner'

and run your tests as normal (``python manage.py test <whatever>``), and if you
have coverage installed, you should see a report when your tests complete.
You could also use ``coverage html`` and open ``htmlcov/index.html`` for a more fancy coverage report.
Make sure you have a ``.coveragerc`` file, though!
